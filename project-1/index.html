          <h2>National Socialist German Workers' Party</h2>
          <p>
            Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) was the leader of the
            <b>National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party)</b> and
            Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945. He rose to power in a
            period of political instability, promising to restore Germany's
            strength and pride after World War I. Under his leadership, the Nazi
            regime pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, leading to World
            War II. Hitler's ideology included a virulent form of anti-Semitism,
            culminating in the Holocaust, where six million Jews and millions of
            others were systematically murdered. His rule ended with Germany's
            defeat and his suicide in 1945.
